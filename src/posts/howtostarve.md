<!-- # Downloading Books onto a Kindle (pictureless)
For this guide, you'll need:
1. One kindle
1. A working computer
1. One Micro USB Cable

Warning: If you're afraid of sailing the seven seas this guide is not for you.

Once you've got all the things arranged, turn to your computer and visit either libgen](https://libgen.is) or [3lib](https://3lib.net/).

Choose the respective book genre and search for it.

A table of results will appear, look through it for the correct author and file extension (we're looking for .mobi files, but you can get by with .epub)

When you've found the book you want, click on it and download it from one of the listed mirrors.
(This step requires being able to navigate around unfamiliar user interfaces without being a helpless slouch.)

If you can only find .epub files, you can convert it to mobi at [this website](https://cloudconvert.com/epub-to-mobi).

After you've finished with that -->
