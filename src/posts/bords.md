## introduction
Birds.  We've all encountered them, and chances are you've seen or heard one recently.

Whether it be from birdsong from afar drifting into your ear canal or head-bobbing fiends congregating in crowds to peck at breadcrumbs, or even in your fast food drive-thru order.

If you haven't gone through a bird-lover phase in your tweens, you probably haven't paid much attention to birds.  Being so wrapped up in our own lives doesn't leave much time for admiring the wildlife, more so if you live in an urban jungle where most birds are head-bobbing pigeons looking for breadcrumbs.

Like any nature nonfiction book worth its salt will tell you, [ insert animals/plants/bacterias/archaes ] play an important role in Earth's ecosystems. The same goes for birds, but to an extent as great as nitrogen-fixing bacteria? that has yet to be seen.

As a sidenote, if you're not aware yet, this isn't an essay about eco-terrorism, but a light traipse through the forest of bird-dom.  Put down your Snopes magnifying glasses because nothing is sacred, not even facts!

In today's blog post, we'll figure out what birds are, why they make the noise™, and if they really exist.  There'll also be a whole lot of bird-related information that may or not be useful.

## The Dawn of the Squawk
In order to figure out if birds are real, we first have to figure out what they are.

The first step to doing that is to take a look back at their place of origin.

![map of the continents during the end of the jurassic period](https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3-5e26c86a89fbf-png__700.jpg)

Earth, circa 150,000,000 BC

An unspeakably long time ago, when the continents looked like chinese knockoffs of your average Mercator projection, the great-great-great-great (repeat this times a few million) grandparent of modern-day birds evolved from some yet-unknown feathered dinosaur.  This creature was the first bird, christened Archaeopteryx by archeologists.

![fossil of Archaeopteryx embedded in rock](https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/VVcr5oUTcXlYNuzVjCHdUD6uxlM=/1500x1000/filters:fill(auto,1)/2048px-Archaeopteryx_fossil-5c5b17f246e0fb0001849b0e.jpg)

The fossilized remains of an Archaeopteryx caught doing *the worm*.

But this fellow certainly had competition.  By the time the Cretaceous rolled around, the featherless cousins of Archeopteryx, pterosaurs, had been around for fifty million years, giving them plenty of time to grow to gargantuan proportions, with carnivorous appetites to match.

There were smaller species of pterosaur, but over time these species started to die out in favor of the larger giraffe-sized pterosaurs.

If you stole a time machine and was face-to-face with a large pterosaur, you would be eaten, so instead here's an sculptor's rendition of the largest species of pterosaur known to us (based on fossils):

![model of the quetzalcoatlus pterosaur next to an 160 centimeter tall man](https://i.redd.it/mjn2gamsosg01.jpg)

Model of quetzalcoatlus northropi next to a guy of average height

The quetzalcoatlus has a stupid beak-to-body ratio, and would be hard to keep in a zoo, mainly because it would keep eating all the exotic animals.
It was essentially a winged, carnivorous giraffe with a giant sword for a head.  

With the discovery of more and more of these types of fossils, evidence increasingly points to the large beak-spears having a dual function as a tool for bored pterosaurs, who could have frequently used them in mock-swordfights with their siblings.

The art of swordsmanship is said to have surfaced in the late Triassic Period

Your average pigeon may dream of glory from days past, when the median temperature was a muggy four celsius above modern times and the pterosaur reigned supreme, but it is mistaken, for its true ancestor was Archaeopteryx, who looked rather timid in comparison.

But in a serendipitous turn of events, something rather big happened 66 million years ago in the northwest margin of the Yucatán Peninsula that wiped out quetzalcoatlus and almost all large species on Earth, robbing them of the opportunity to evolve into even more formidable and giving Archaeopteryx an immeasurable advantage.

### Conjecture?
Unfortunately, dried old bones can't tell us everything.  There's a fair amount of guesswork at play here, so we can't be certain what pterosaurs and Archaeopteryx looked like unless we invent a time machine.
Pterosaurs may have been a startling shade of hot pink for all we know.

## On the Origin of S̶p̶e̶c̶i̶e̶s̶ Birds

About 73,000 days ago, a twenty-something university graduate preparing for a mundane career as a clergyman recieved an invite
from the ship's captain to join the 10-gun warship-turned survey ship the SMH Beagle (supposedly the ship's captain was in need of a geologist).
Ten points if you can guess who the university graduate was (If you can't for some reason, it was Charles Darwin). During the voyage,
while the ship and crew carried out coastline surveys Darwin did as he pleased, thinking up what was to become the book
everyone recognizes him for. 

After surveying the coasts of South America (A lesser-known fact about Darwin is that during this time, he discovered a
lesser-known species dubbed "the sea-llama of Peru"), the SMH Beagle stopped by the Galapagos Islands. It was here that he
started accumulating finches for his nautical menagerie.

<!-- Artists' renditions of a nearly ten-thousand day old Darwin in the Galapagos are almost always incorrect. The only 
photographs of non-baby Darwin are either of him as decrepit old man or as a balding, middle-aged man. -->

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MlVAhKz.jpg"/>
<p class="image-caption">Birds are a spectrum, explained with Darwin's finches</p>

As with the finches, birds are a spectrum. If you take a picture of each bird species and line them up, you'll have a bird gradient.
And they all evolved from only a few surviving pterosaurs.

The process by which the lucky pterosaurs morphed into birds was an excruciatingly slow one.
Thankfully, it already happened! A few million generations of pterosaurs kept mutating until 
voila, birds!
But what about the in-between stages? Natural selection only picks its best, so each version
had to be the most successful. It might look a little strange to see an amphibious wolf, but
that lady was the great-great grandmother of modern-day whales.

How did the evolutionary process of birbs go? First, they grew proper teethless beaks.
Gizzards became a new evolutionary adaptation that uses stones the bird swallows to aid in
chewing food (It should be noted that #NotAllBirds use swallowed bits of gravel to grind up food)
Their other fingers fell off, and the remaining one got even longer.
There's still an ongoing debate about if pterosaurs had feathers or not, so modern-day birds
may or may not have evolved feathers on their own after the extinction.

Given enough time, just a single species can fractal out into hundreds, even thousands
of different species.

## Basic Biology
When genetics visits the Build-A-Bird Workshop, it goes through **seven simple steps** to create a brand-new bird:

<p class="no-mb"><strong>Choose Me:</strong> It choose the species of bird — from a tiny hummingbird to a bulky ostrich and a preening peacock to a seafaring seagull.</p>
<p class="no-mb"><strong>Hear Me:</strong> It adds a certain set of sounds to the bird's voice box.*****</p>
<p class="no-mb"><strong>Stuff Me:</strong> It begins to fill the bird template with specific organs, bones and muscles.</p>
<p class="no-mb"><strong>Hug Me:</strong> It gives it a squeeze to gauge the robustness of the skeletal structure and musculature.</p>
<p class="no-mb"><strong>Dress Me:</strong> Genetics applies external features such as beaks, feathers and wings to the part-sockets.</p>
<p class="no-mb"><strong>Name Me:</strong> Genetics leaves the name blank.  In a few million years, another simian species will do the naming for it.</p>
<p><strong>Take Me Home:</strong> The newly created bird hatches from its mothers egg, and becomes yet another player in the Game of Life.</p>

All bird species share certain traits.  Feathers, wings, beaks, and the ability to lay eggs.  Most birds also have hollow bones (to be light enough to fly),
with the exception of flightless birds.  (In the frigid deserts of the Antarctic, penguins have thicc bones with marrow that functions similar to antifreeze.
Ostriches, too, have thicc, hefty bones.  They're capable of delivering nasty bonks to ne'er-do-wells)

To determine if any questionable creature is a bird or not, run through the trait checklist.
The animal in question should have at least two of the features listed.

## Tidbits

This can be classified as the factoid chapter, where we take a look at weird adaptations found in certain birds.

We'll start with <HoverImage src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZKvIohYcL.jpg">flamboyant</HoverImage> pink flamingos.  They take on a more reddish hue due to the
red pigments found in their prey of choice, brine shrimp.  It's not just their skin that's pink,
it's everything else too.
They also do the famous one-legged stand. There are many theories
for why this is, but a likely reason is that flamingos, like women in cold offices, lose heat 
through their legs and feet.  By standing with one leg angled and resting on the other leg,
they may preserve body warmth.

Woodpeckers are known for drilling into tree bark with their beaks to harvest tasty tree-dwelling insects.  When the beak pokes through the
rough outer bark, a subterranean cave (or rather, bark) system is exposed, carved into the flesh of the tree by the invertebrates
living in it.  These tunnels are narrow and can be quite long and winding.
To better extract the tasty insects, Woodpeckers evolved long, flexible tongues (sometimes barbed)
capable of dislodging ants and larvae from deep crevices.
But the question remains, how does a tongue that long fit in a woodpecker's head?
Pictured below is a list of possible ways to store an unreasonably long tongue, can you guess
which is the correct answer?

<!-- have an interesting adaptation -->

If you answered (), you're wrong, but it would sure be a sight to see.
If you answered (), you win a gold sticker! 

When you hear the word nocturnal, what do you think of first? For many, it's an owl.
They're the poster boys of animal night life.  Because of their lifestyle, they
developed huge eyes that maximized light collection. Unfortunately, their couldn't get larger,
so the eyes filled out into the fixed tube shape we know today.
To make up for the lack of eyeballs, owls evolved an impressive range of neck rotation, up to
270 degrees. This handy adaptation is the bane of hungry owlets across the globe, who can't
steal beetles from the beetle jar without mom catching them red-handed.

<p class="no-mb">We can't forget parrots, the <HoverImage src="https://i.imgur.com/BAwHwq1.jpg">big brainest</HoverImage> birds in the Aves class.
Like little brats, parrots are vocal leaners.  They grasp sounds by listening and repeating them.
In the wild, this is meant for communication with their friends and family, but when shoved
in an urban, parrot-free environment they'll start cozying up to their human caretakers.
They are also very intelligentia compared to the rest of the animal kingdom, which admittedly isn't
a high bar.</p>
In the end, they just want to <HoverImage src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/breadadams/fetch-the-parrot/HEAD/demo/assets/parrot.gif">boogie</HoverImage>.

Loathed by rural livestock owners and [animal poachers](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286165518_Ivory_poachers_and_poison_drivers_of_Africa%27s_declining_vulture_populations)
alike, vultures have exceptionally corrosive stomachs that allow them to chow down
on rotting carcasses without fear of infection.
Vultures the birds, unlike the website, actually provide a crucial role in the health of their
habitats, by keeping the savannah safe from deadly diseases and foul-smelling remains swarming with flies.

It's a bee! It's a plane! It's a hummingbird!  More bee-like than bird, hummingbirds beat their wings so fast they turn into a shimmering
blur, and use their suspiciously proboscis-like beaks to drink the nectar from flowers.

## Aeronautically Challenged Birds
Despite birds evolved from a creature that already knew how to fly, some birds decided to
un-evolve flight. Why is this?
The common consensus among ornithologists is that they simply didn't want to fly.
Flight, in spite of its coolness among animal peers, is energy-consuming and puts
restrictions on a birds' body plan that flightless birds thought were too cumbersome.

Ostriches are melee brawlers, with thick, heavy bones.  What they lack in the flight department,
they overcompensate by being terrors of the outback. They might be generally herbivores,
but if you anger an ostrich mom, you've got another thing coming.

Penguins ditched a life of cruising the skies for exploring the seas. 
Evolution, being perhaps the most skilled sculptor of all time, gave penguins a shape
so effective for swimming that nothing we lowly apes have designed ourselves can match.

In some locations, there just wasn't a need to.
Some advantages of being flightless is that you are free of the restrictions that flight
entails, like having to have light bones and a smaller size.


“According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a hummingbird should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. ...
Because hummingbirds don't care what humans think is impossible.” -- 🅱️ Movie
Hummingbirds are unlike other birds, not just because they're tiny and

<p class="image-caption"></p>

Studies have shown that the better the flight, the worse the swimming.  Penguins are one of
the most skilled swimmers in the Aves class, but are permanently grounded.  Different body
plans are suited for different things.
