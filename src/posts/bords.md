## introduction
Birds.  We've all encountered them, and chances are you've seen or heard one recently.
Whether it be from birdsong from afar drifting into your ear canal or head-bobbing fiends congregating
in crowds to peck at breadcrumbs, or even in your fast food drive-thru order.

To readers who haven't gone through a bird-lover phase in their tweens, they come across as ornamental,
living background props moving on a dolly while the epic opera of human history unfolds. 
Well, you thought wrong! I'm here to rip open the curtains and shatter the illusion.  There are no crickets in Wayward Pines!
Like every other species, birds fit together in ecosystems like the
the missing piece from your 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle.

## The Dawn of the Squawk
In order to figure out if birds are real, we first have to figure out what they are.
The first step to doing that is to take a look back at their place of origin.

Forty-five billion days ago on the ancient supercontinent of Pangaea (the "pan" part comes from pancakes, due to the continent's pancake-like shape and considering that the geologist in charge of naming ancient proto-continents had skipped breakfast that day and was conjuring up delectable images of fluffy golden pancakes topped with pats of butter and soaked with syrup dripping down in rivulets over the crisp brown edges, and the "gaea" part is a throwback to that one time the Ancient Greeks gave the Earth a fursona), the great-great-great(repeat this times a few million)-grandparents of (cont.)

(cont.) modern-day birds were showing their faces for the first time, having evolved from a flightless dinosaur species not too long ago.
They were known as pterosaurs, and were actually voracious airborne monsters, as massive as they were mean.  They were the bane of many
earthbound dinosaur moms, whose precious hatchlings were the perfect bite-sized meal for the apex predators (the juveniles were swallowed whole)

If you looked at one up close (provided you were a suicidal madman), they would look a lot like overgrown leathery cranes that dialed
up the head and neck size to 11.

<p class="image-caption">Model of Quetzalcoatlus northropi next to a 180cm tall dude</p>

When it came to pterosaurs, the substantial Quetzalcoatlus was the most impressive of the lot (pictured above).
It was essentially a winged giraffe with a giant sword for a head.
Surprisingly, Quinoafloatmust were toothless. A theory goes that they fed like [skimmers](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Rynchops), with their comically sized bodies
gliding over water, cleaving the waves with their proto-beaks in the search for fish.  Later, a few sceptical paleontologists
debunked the theory with a study that showed the skim-feeding method generating too much drag to be efficient.

<img src="insert pic"/>
<p class="image-caption">Inefficiency of the proposed skim-feeding method</p>

Another, more convincing theory is that Quadruplesmoketusks were terrestial hunters that hunted small vertebrates on land
(sorry, dinosaur moms).

With the discovery of more and more fossils, evidence increasingly points to the large beak-spears
having a dual function as a tool for bored pterosaurs, who could have frequently used them in mock-swordfights with their siblings. 

<img src="insert pic"/>
<p class="image-caption">The art of swordsmanship is said to have surfaced in the late Triassic Period</p>

For quite a long time, pterosaurs flourished in the substantially oxygen-rich and humid sans-ice-caps world of yesteryear.
They would likely have continued to become even more apexy predatory, but we all know what happened 66 million years ago
in the northwest margin of the Yucatán Peninsula.
Sadly, the much-described Pretzelsoapdust went with 75% of all living species at the time into the ether, and then there were none.

Have you noticed all of the "would likelys" and "could haves"? It's because no one *really* knows what pterosaurs were like.
They may have been a startling shade of hot pink for all we know.  Unfortunately, dried old bones can't tell us everything.

## On the Origin of S̶p̶e̶c̶i̶e̶s̶ Birds

About 73,000 days ago, a twenty-something university graduate preparing for a mundane career as a clergyman recieved an invite
from the ship's captain to join the 10-gun warship-turned survey ship the SMH Beagle (supposedly the ship's captain was in need of a geologist).
Ten points if you can guess who the university graduate was (If you can't for some reason, it was Charles Darwin). During the voyage,
while the ship and crew carried out coastline surveys Darwin did as he pleased, thinking up what was to become the book
everyone recognizes him for. 

After surveying the coasts of South America (A lesser-known fact about Darwin is that during this time, he discovered a
lesser-known species dubbed "the sea-llama of Peru"), the SMH Beagle stopped by the Galapagos Islands. It was here that he
started accumulating finches for his nautical menagerie.

<!-- Artists' renditions of a nearly ten-thousand day old Darwin in the Galapagos are almost always incorrect. The only 
photographs of non-baby Darwin are either of him as decrepit old man or as a balding, middle-aged man. -->

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MlVAhKz.jpg"/>
<p class="image-caption">Birds are a spectrum, explained with Darwin's finches</p>

As with the finches, birds are a spectrum. If you take a picture of each bird species and line them up, you'll have a bird gradient.
And they all evolved from only a few surviving pterosaurs.

The process by which the lucky pterosaurs morphed into birds was an excruciatingly slow one.
Thankfully, it already happened! A few million generations of pterosaurs kept mutating until 
voila, birds!
But what about the in-between stages? Natural selection only picks its best, so each version
had to be the most successful. It might look a little strange to see an amphibious wolf, but
that lady was the great-great grandmother of modern-day whales.

How did the evolutionary process of birbs go? First, they grew proper teethless beaks.
Gizzards became a new evolutionary adaptation that uses stones the bird swallows to aid in
chewing food (It should be noted that #NotAllBirds use swallowed bits of gravel to grind up food)
Their other fingers fell off, and the remaining one got even longer.
There's still an ongoing debate about if pterosaurs had feathers or not, so modern-day birds
may or may not have evolved feathers on their own after the extinction.

Given enough time, just a single species can fractal out into hundreds, even thousands
of different species.

## Basic Biology
When genetics visits the Build-A-Bird Workshop, it goes through **seven simple steps** to create a brand-new bird:

<p class="no-mb"><strong>Choose Me:</strong> It choose the species of bird — from a tiny hummingbird to a bulky ostrich and a preening peacock to a seafaring seagull.</p>
<p class="no-mb"><strong>Hear Me:</strong> It adds a certain set of sounds to the bird's voice box.*****</p>
<p class="no-mb"><strong>Stuff Me:</strong> It begins to fill the bird template with specific organs, bones and muscles.</p>
<p class="no-mb"><strong>Hug Me:</strong> It gives it a squeeze to gauge the robustness of the skeletal structure and musculature.</p>
<p class="no-mb"><strong>Dress Me:</strong> Genetics applies external features such as beaks, feathers and wings to the part-sockets.</p>
<p class="no-mb"><strong>Name Me:</strong> Genetics leaves the name blank.  In a few million years, another simian species will do the naming for it.</p>
<p><strong>Take Me Home:</strong> The newly created bird hatches from its mothers egg, and becomes yet another player in the Game of Life.</p>

All bird species share certain traits.  Feathers, wings, beaks, and the ability to lay eggs.  Most birds also have hollow bones (to be light enough to fly),
with the exception of flightless birds.  (In the frigid deserts of the Antarctic, penguins have thicc bones with marrow that functions similar to antifreeze.
Ostriches, too, have thicc, hefty bones.  They're capable of delivering nasty bonks to ne'er-do-wells)

To determine if any questionable creature is a bird or not, run through the trait checklist.
The animal in question should have at least two of the features listed.

## Tidbits

This can be classified as the factoid chapter, where we take a look at weird adaptations found in certain birds.

We'll start with <HoverImage src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZKvIohYcL.jpg">flamboyant</HoverImage> pink flamingos.  They take on a more reddish hue due to the
red pigments found in their prey of choice, brine shrimp.  It's not just their skin that's pink,
it's everything else too.
They also do the famous one-legged stand. There are many theories
for why this is, but a likely reason is that flamingos, like women in cold offices, lose heat 
through their legs and feet.  By standing with one leg angled and resting on the other leg,
they may preserve body warmth.

Woodpeckers are known for drilling into tree bark with their beaks to harvest tasty tree-dwelling insects.  When the beak pokes through the
rough outer bark, a subterranean cave (or rather, bark) system is exposed, carved into the flesh of the tree by the invertebrates
living in it.  These tunnels are narrow and can be quite long and winding.
To better extract the tasty insects, Woodpeckers evolved long, flexible tongues (sometimes barbed)
capable of dislodging ants and larvae from deep crevices.
But the question remains, how does a tongue that long fit in a woodpecker's head?
Pictured below is a list of possible ways to store an unreasonably long tongue, can you guess
which is the correct answer?

<!-- have an interesting adaptation -->

If you answered (), you're wrong, but it would sure be a sight to see.
If you answered (), you win a gold sticker! 

When you hear the word nocturnal, what do you think of first? For many, it's an owl.
They're the poster boys of animal night life.  Because of their lifestyle, they
developed huge eyes that maximized light collection. Unfortunately, their couldn't get larger,
so the eyes filled out into the fixed tube shape we know today.
To make up for the lack of eyeballs, owls evolved an impressive range of neck rotation, up to
270 degrees. This handy adaptation is the bane of hungry owlets across the globe, who can't
steal beetles from the beetle jar without mom catching them red-handed.

<p class="no-mb">We can't forget parrots, the <HoverImage src="https://i.imgur.com/BAwHwq1.jpg">big brainest</HoverImage> birds in the Aves class.
Like little brats, parrots are vocal leaners.  They grasp sounds by listening and repeating them.
In the wild, this is meant for communication with their friends and family, but when shoved
in an urban, parrot-free environment they'll start cozying up to their human caretakers.
They are also very intelligentia compared to the rest of the animal kingdom, which admittedly isn't
a high bar.</p>
In the end, they just want to <HoverImage src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/breadadams/fetch-the-parrot/HEAD/demo/assets/parrot.gif">boogie</HoverImage>.

Loathed by rural livestock owners and [animal poachers](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286165518_Ivory_poachers_and_poison_drivers_of_Africa%27s_declining_vulture_populations)
alike, vultures have exceptionally corrosive stomachs that allow them to chow down
on rotting carcasses without fear of infection.
Vultures the birds, unlike the website, actually provide a crucial role in the health of their
habitats, by keeping the savannah safe from deadly diseases and foul-smelling remains swarming with flies.

It's a bee! It's a plane! It's a hummingbird!  More bee-like than bird, hummingbirds beat their wings so fast they turn into a shimmering
blur, and use their suspiciously proboscis-like beaks to drink the nectar from flowers.

## Aeronautically Challenged Birds
Despite birds evolved from a creature that already knew how to fly, some birds decided to
un-evolve flight. Why is this?
The common consensus among ornithologists is that they simply didn't want to fly.
Flight, in spite of its coolness among animal peers, is energy-consuming and puts
restrictions on a birds' body plan that flightless birds thought were too cumbersome.

Ostriches are melee brawlers, with thick, heavy bones.  What they lack in the flight department,
they overcompensate by being terrors of the outback. They might be generally herbivores,
but if you anger an ostrich mom, you've got another thing coming.

Penguins ditched a life of cruising the skies for exploring the seas. 
Evolution, being perhaps the most skilled sculptor of all time, gave penguins a shape
so effective for swimming that nothing we lowly apes have designed ourselves can match.

In some locations, there just wasn't a need to.
Some advantages of being flightless is that you are free of the restrictions that flight
entails, like having to have light bones and a smaller size.


“According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a hummingbird should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. ...
Because hummingbirds don't care what humans think is impossible.” -- 🅱️ Movie
Hummingbirds are unlike other birds, not just because they're tiny and

<p class="image-caption"></p>

Studies have shown that the better the flight, the worse the swimming.  Penguins are one of
the most skilled swimmers in the Aves class, but are permanently grounded.  Different body
plans are suited for different things.
